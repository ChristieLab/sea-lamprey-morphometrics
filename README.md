Data analysis scripts for "Larger larval sea lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>) have longer survival times when exposed to the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol", 
written by Allison M. Nalesnik and William Hemstrom

##
calculate_initial_length_after_ethanol_storage.R  --> A usable resource for anyone looking to back calculate the initial length of larval sea lamprey stored in 95% EtOH. 
Requires (1) length measurements and (2) number of storage days in EtOH. Uses the length estimate from our best model generated in etoh_model_combined_samples.R.

##
survivorship_models.R --> All models reported in our manuscript.

##
etoh_model_arl_samples.R --> Script used to analysis larval sea lamprey housed at Purdue University's Aquaculture Research Lab for ethanol shrinkage experiment A. (ESE A)

##
etoh_model_hbbs_samples.R --> Script used to analysis larval sea lamprey housed at Hammond Bay Biological Station for ethanol shrinkage experiment B. (ESE B)

##
etoh_model_combined_samples.R --> Script used to combine and analyze the combined data set of larval sea lamprey housed at Purdue University's Aquaculture Research Lab (ESE A)
and Hammond Bay Biological Station (ESE B).
